    theory: { content: `Never touched SQL? You are in the right place. We start from nothing.

## what a database is

A database is just information kept in tables. A table is a grid, like a
spreadsheet. Each **row** is one thing (one employee). Each **column** is one
fact about it (a name, a salary).

This course comes with a small company database. One of its tables is called
\`employees\`. To look at a table, you write a **query**. The simplest query
reads a whole table:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
\`\`\`

Read it in plain English: \`SELECT\` means "get me", \`*\` means "every column",
and \`FROM employees\` says which table. So the line means "get me every column
from the employees table." Run it and all 20 employees appear below.

> 💡 **Key:** SQL is how you ask a database questions. You write a query, run it,
and read the rows that come back. That loop is the whole job.

> ✨ **Tip:** the semicolon ends a statement. Get in the habit of adding it.` },

      { title: "Read a whole table", explanation: "SELECT * returns every column for every row", sql: "SELECT * FROM employees;" },

      { id: "sh-sql-2", prompt: "Now read every column from the employees table the same way.", hint: "SELECT * FROM employees;", expectedColumns: ["id","name","department","salary","hire_date","manager_id"], validateFn: "return rows.length >= 1;", solution: "SELECT * FROM employees;" }

\`SELECT *\` grabs every column. Usually you only want a few. Instead of the
star, list the columns you want by name, separated by commas:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
\`\`\`

That returns just two columns, name and salary, for all employees. The order you
list them is the order they come back in.

> 💡 **Key:** name the columns you want and you get a cleaner result than
\`SELECT *\`. In real work you almost always name them.

are normal and they are trying to help.` },

Every lesson has the same shape:

- **Theory** explains the idea in plain words (you are reading it).
- **Examples** show it working. Read them, then change a column or a table name
  and run them to see what happens. Poking at working examples is how you learn.
- **Challenges** make you write the query yourself. This is where the learning
  actually happens. Reading SQL feels easy and fools you. Writing it from memory
  is the skill.

> 💡 **Key:** finished lessons come back later for a quick review, spaced out
over days. That spacing is the most reliable way known to move something from "I
saw it once" to "I just know it." Let it happen.

When you get stuck, and you will, work it in this order:

1. Read the error. It tells you what went wrong and points at the problem.
2. Re-read the prompt. Many stuck moments are a misread instruction.
3. Open the hint.
4. Ask the tutor (bottom-right dock). It nudges you toward the answer instead of
   handing it over.

will feel like you learned it. You did not. Sit with it for a minute first.

Aggregate functions collapse many rows into a single number. Instead of listing 20 salaries, COUNT tells you there are 20. SUM adds them all up. AVG gives the average. They answer the "how many / how much total / what's the average" questions.

| SUM(column) | Add up all values |
| AVG(column) | Average of all values |

\`\`\`sql
SELECT grouping_column, AGG_FUNCTION(other_column)
FROM table
GROUP BY grouping_column;
\`\`\`

## the golden rule
**Every column in SELECT must either be in GROUP BY or be inside an aggregate function.** If you GROUP BY department, you can SELECT department and AVG(salary), but not name, because there are multiple names per department and SQL doesn't know which one to show.

1. SQL splits the table into groups by the GROUP BY column
2. For each group, it runs the aggregate functions
3. You get one output row per unique group value

## the slow way vs the fast way
**Slow:** group everyone first, then throw most of them away with HAVING. SQL has to aggregate every department before the filter runs.
\`\`\`sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING department = 'Engineering';
\`\`\`

**Fast:** filter rows in the WHERE clause before aggregation runs. Only one department gets grouped.

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Engineering'
GROUP BY department;
\`\`\`

Why: HAVING runs after GROUP BY; WHERE runs before. Use HAVING only for filters that depend on the aggregate itself (\`HAVING AVG(salary) > 80000\`). Non-aggregate filters belong in WHERE so the optimizer can shrink the input.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** putting a non-aggregated column in SELECT that isn't in GROUP BY. SQLite silently picks one row per group; SQL Server errors out. Either add the column to GROUP BY or wrap it in an aggregate like MAX or MIN.

    title: "INNER JOIN", badge: "concept", database: "company",
    theory: { content: `> 🎯 **Why This Matters:** Data lives in many tables on purpose; it's called normalization. Joins are how you put it back together to answer a single question. Without joins you're stuck in one table at a time.

An INNER JOIN is like a Venn diagram; you only get rows that exist in BOTH tables. If an employee has no matching department, they're excluded. If a department has no employees, it's excluded.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT e.name, d.location
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department = d.name;
\`\`\`
(INNER JOIN and JOIN mean the same thing; JOIN is shorthand)

- The ON clause specifies the matching condition; usually a foreign key relationship
- Use table aliases (e, d) to keep queries readable and avoid ambiguity
- When both tables have a column with the same name, prefix with the alias: \`e.name\` vs \`d.name\`

## the slow way vs the fast way
**Slow / risky:** the old comma-join syntax. Forget the WHERE and you silently produce a cartesian product.
\`\`\`sql
SELECT e.name, d.location
FROM employees e, departments d
WHERE e.department = d.name;
\`\`\`

**Fast / safe:** explicit JOIN ... ON. The relationship lives next to the table, not buried in WHERE, and forgetting the ON is a syntax error instead of a quietly catastrophic result.
\`\`\`sql
SELECT e.name, d.location
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON d.name = e.department;
\`\`\`

Why: same query plan in modern engines, but the explicit form is reviewable. The danger of the comma form isn't slowness, it's the night you forget the WHERE on a 10-million-row table and produce 10^14 rows.

FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employee_projects ep ON e.id = ep.employee_id
LEFT JOIN projects p ON ep.project_id = p.id;
\`\`\`

## INNER vs LEFT
- INNER JOIN: only rows with matches in both tables
- LEFT JOIN: all rows from left table, NULLs if no match on right

## finding missing relationships
LEFT JOIN + WHERE right_table.id IS NULL finds rows in the left table with NO match on the right. Classic pattern for "find employees not assigned to any project."

## the slow way vs the fast way
**Slow / wrong:** \`NOT IN\` with a subquery that might return NULL. If a single row in the subquery is NULL, the entire result is empty. Silent data loss.
\`\`\`sql
-- returns ZERO rows if employee_projects has any NULL employee_id
SELECT name FROM employees
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM employee_projects);
\`\`\`

**Fast / correct:** LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL. NULL-safe, uses the same index path a normal join would, and reads as what it actually does ("the left rows with no match").
\`\`\`sql
SELECT e.name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employee_projects ep ON ep.employee_id = e.id
WHERE ep.employee_id IS NULL;
\`\`\`

Why: \`x NOT IN (... NULL ...)\` evaluates to \`x != NULL\`, which is UNKNOWN, which filters out every row. The LEFT JOIN form never has that trap.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** filtering the right table in WHERE undoes the LEFT JOIN. \`LEFT JOIN ... WHERE right.col = 'x'\` excludes the unmatched rows you were trying to keep. Move filters on the right table into the ON clause; keep WHERE for the left.` },

    moduleSlug: "subqueries-ctes", lessonSlug: "subqueries-where",
    title: "Subqueries in WHERE", badge: "concept", database: "company",
    theory: { content: `> 🎯 **Why This Matters:** Subqueries are how you ask a question whose answer depends on another question. The whole module is about building queries in layers instead of trying to write one giant statement.

A subquery is a query inside a query. SQL runs the inner query first, gets a result, then uses that result in the outer query. Think of it as answering a preliminary question so you can answer the main question.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
\`\`\`

- The inner query (in parentheses) runs first and returns a value
- The outer query uses that value just like a literal number or string
- Scalar subqueries return one value; list subqueries (used with IN) return multiple values

## with IN
\`\`\`sql
WHERE department IN (SELECT name FROM departments WHERE budget > 1000000)
\`\`\`

## the slow way vs the fast way
**Slow:** a correlated subquery that recomputes the same aggregate once per outer row. With 10,000 employees and 100 departments, this runs the SELECT AVG... 10,000 times.
\`\`\`sql
SELECT e.name, e.salary
FROM employees e
WHERE e.salary > (
  SELECT AVG(salary)
  FROM employees x
  WHERE x.department = e.department
);
\`\`\`

**Fast:** compute the per-department averages once in a CTE, then join. The aggregate fires 100 times total, not 10,000.
\`\`\`sql
WITH dept_avg AS (
  SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
)
SELECT e.name, e.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN dept_avg d ON d.department = e.department
WHERE e.salary > d.avg_sal;
\`\`\`

Why: \`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN\` on the first form shows a nested SCAN per outer row. The CTE form shows one SCAN of employees for the aggregate, then one SCAN for the outer query. Less work, easier to reason about.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** using \`=\` with a subquery that returns more than one row. SQL Server errors. SQLite is more permissive and silently keeps only the first row it happens to read, which is worse: you get a wrong answer with no warning. Use IN for multi-row subqueries; reserve \`=\` for ones guaranteed scalar (MAX, MIN, COUNT, a LIMIT 1 ORDER BY ...).` },

    theory: { content: `A correlated subquery references the outer query. It runs once for every row the outer query processes; the inner query uses a value from the current outer row. Slower than regular subqueries, but necessary for row-by-row comparisons.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT name, salary, department
FROM employees e
WHERE salary > (
  SELECT AVG(salary)
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = e.department  -- references outer query's row
);
\`\`\`

- For each employee row in the outer query, the subquery runs with that employee's department
- It compares each employee against their own department's average, not the company average
- The outer alias (e) is accessible inside the subquery

## the slow way vs the fast way
**Slow:** \`(SELECT COUNT(*) ...) = 0\` to test "does this row have any match." Counts every match before comparing.
\`\`\`sql
SELECT e.name
FROM employees e
WHERE (
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee_projects ep
  WHERE ep.employee_id = e.id
) = 0;
\`\`\`

**Fast:** \`NOT EXISTS\` short-circuits at the first match. As soon as one row is found, the subquery stops.
\`\`\`sql
SELECT e.name
FROM employees e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM employee_projects ep
  WHERE ep.employee_id = e.id
);
\`\`\`

Why: \`EXISTS\` and \`NOT EXISTS\` are designed to short-circuit, so the engine returns the moment the answer is known. \`COUNT(*) = 0\` always reads every matching row before it can decide.` },

INSERT adds new rows to a table. You specify the table, the columns you're filling, and the values for each column in the same order.

\`\`\`sql
-- Insert one row (explicit columns; recommended)
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary, hire_date)

String functions let you manipulate text inside a query; clean it, transform it, extract pieces from it. Essential for messy real-world data.

## common functions (SQLite)
| Function | What it does | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| LENGTH(s) | Character count | LENGTH('hello') → 5 |
| UPPER(s) | All uppercase | UPPER('hello') → 'HELLO' |
| LOWER(s) | All lowercase | LOWER('Hello') → 'hello' |
| TRIM(s) | Remove leading/trailing spaces | TRIM(' hi ') → 'hi' |
| SUBSTR(s, start, len) | Extract substring | SUBSTR('hello', 2, 3) → 'ell' |
| REPLACE(s, old, new) | Replace text | REPLACE('hi world', 'world', 'there') → 'hi there' |
| INSTR(s, sub) | Find position of substring | INSTR('hello', 'ell') → 2 |
| s || s | Concatenate strings | 'Hello' || ' ' || 'World' |

    title: "ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK", badge: "challenge", database: "company",
    theory: { content: `> 🎯 **Why This Matters:** Window functions are the single biggest pedagogical jump in SQL. Most analyst job posts in 2026 want them. Top-N per group, running totals, period-over-period; all of it is window functions.

Window functions add a new column to every row without collapsing the table. GROUP BY loses individual rows. Window functions keep them all and add computed values alongside.

## the three ranking functions
\`\`\`sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)  -- 1,2,3,4,5... no ties
RANK()       OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)  -- 1,2,2,4,5... ties get same rank, gap after
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)  -- 1,2,2,3,4... ties get same rank, no gap
\`\`\`

## picking the RIGHT one
- **ROW_NUMBER**: when you don't care about ties; you want exactly N rows back. Top-3 paginators, deduplication.
- **RANK**: when ties matter and the gap is informative. "I'm tied for 2nd, the next person is 4th."
- **DENSE_RANK**: when ties matter but you want consecutive ranks. Bucketing, tier assignment, "show the top 3 distinct salaries."

Run the first example below to actually see the difference on real rows.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT name, salary,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;
\`\`\`

## the slow way vs the fast way
**Slow:** the classic pre-window-function trick of "count how many rows beat me" with a self-join. O(n²) within each group.
\`\`\`sql
SELECT e1.name, e1.department, e1.salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE (
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees e2
  WHERE e2.department = e1.department
    AND e2.salary > e1.salary
) < 3;
\`\`\`

**Fast:** a single pass with \`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)\`. One sort per partition, no self-join.
\`\`\`sql
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM (
  SELECT name, department, salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rn
  FROM employees
) t
WHERE rn <= 3;
\`\`\`

Why: window functions exist specifically so you don't have to self-join. \`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN\` on the self-join shows a SCAN of employees inside another SCAN; the window-function form shows a single SCAN plus a sort.

A view is a saved query with a name. You create it once, then query it like a table. It doesn't store data; it runs the query every time you SELECT from it. Think of it as a shortcut or a named lens on your data.

- Simplify complex queries you run repeatedly

## T-SQL syntax (SQL Server / WCTC class)
\`\`\`sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDept
  @Department NVARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
  SELECT name, salary, hire_date
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = @Department
  ORDER BY salary DESC;
END;

-- Call it
EXEC GetEmployeesByDept @Department = 'Engineering';
\`\`\`

## why use stored procedures?
- Reusable; call with different parameters
- Secure; grant EXECUTE permission without exposing tables
- Fewer round trips; the app sends one call instead of a full query (SQL Server caches plans for parameterized ad-hoc queries too, so raw speed is rarely the main reason)
- Maintainable; change the proc, all callers benefit

A recursive CTE calls itself; like a loop. It has an anchor (the starting point) and a recursive member (the step that builds on the previous result). It keeps going until no new rows are produced.

\`\`\`sql
WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
  -- Anchor: start with the CEO (no manager)

  -- Recursive: add employees who report to someone already in the CTE
  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, oc.level + 1
  FROM employees e
  JOIN org_chart oc ON e.manager_id = oc.id
)
SELECT * FROM org_chart ORDER BY level, name;
\`\`\`

1. Anchor query runs once, gives the starting rows
2. Recursive member joins the CTE to itself, adding the next "level"

    title: "Stored Procedures", badge: "concept", database: "company",
    theory: { content: `
Think of a stored procedure as a saved script you can run over and over. Instead of typing out the same query every time, you save it with a name and just call that name. It's like a function in programming but for SQL.

Stored procedures keep business logic in the database instead of scattered across application code. The app calls one line and the database handles the work.

## T-SQL syntax

\`\`\`sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDept
    @DeptName NVARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT name, salary, hire_date
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = @DeptName
    ORDER BY salary DESC;
END;

-- now you just call it like this
EXEC GetEmployeesByDept @DeptName = 'Engineering';
\`\`\`

## parameters

You can have input params (data going in) and output params (data coming back out):

\`\`\`sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetDeptStats
    @DeptName NVARCHAR(50),
    @AvgSalary DECIMAL(10,2) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT @AvgSalary = AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = @DeptName;
END;
\`\`\`

## why use them?

- Reusable: write once, call from anywhere
- Fewer round trips: the app sends one call, not a full query (SQL Server also caches plans for parameterized ad-hoc queries, so raw speed is rarely the main reason)
- Secure: you can grant EXEC permission without exposing tables
- Maintainable: change the proc, all callers get the update

## SQLite note

    title: "Temp Tables", badge: "concept", database: "company",
    theory: { content: `
Temp tables are temporary storage that only exists for your session. Super useful when you need to stage data, break a complex query into steps, or store intermediate results.

I use these all the time when a query gets too complicated. Break it into pieces, dump results into a temp table, then query that.

## T-SQL syntax

\`\`\`sql
-- Local temp table (only you can see it, # prefix)
CREATE TABLE #MyTempTable (
    id INT,
    name NVARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO #MyTempTable
SELECT id, name, salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';

-- Query it like any table
SELECT * FROM #MyTempTable WHERE salary > 90000;

-- It auto-deletes when your session ends
-- or you can drop it manually:
DROP TABLE #MyTempTable;
\`\`\`

## local vs global

| Type | Prefix | Scope |
|------|--------|-------|
| Local | # | Only your session |
| Global | ## | All sessions (careful!) |

Global temp tables stick around until the last session using them disconnects. I almost never use global temp tables tbh, local is safer.

## SQLite equivalent

SQLite uses regular tables with TEMP or TEMPORARY keyword:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE my_temp AS
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';
\`\`\`

## when to use temp tables

- Breaking complex queries into readable steps
- Storing intermediate results for reuse
- Testing and debugging complicated logic
- Performance: sometimes materializing a step is faster than repeating a subquery` },

    title: "WHILE Loops and Iteration", badge: "practice", database: "company",
    theory: { content: `
SQL is set-based, meaning it processes whole sets of rows at once. But sometimes you need row-by-row processing. That's where WHILE loops come in.

Fair warning: loops in SQL are usually slower than set-based operations. Try to solve problems with regular queries first. Only use loops when you really need them.

## T-SQL while syntax

\`\`\`sql
DECLARE @counter INT = 1;
DECLARE @maxId INT;

SELECT @maxId = MAX(id) FROM employees;

WHILE @counter <= @maxId
BEGIN
    -- do something with each id
    PRINT 'Processing ID: ' + CAST(@counter AS VARCHAR);
    SET @counter = @counter + 1;
END;
\`\`\`

## cursors (row-by-row processing)

When you need to loop through actual query results:

\`\`\`sql
DECLARE emp_cursor CURSOR FOR
    SELECT id, name, salary FROM employees;

DECLARE @id INT, @name NVARCHAR(100), @salary DECIMAL;

OPEN emp_cursor;
FETCH NEXT FROM emp_cursor INTO @id, @name, @salary;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    -- process each row here
    PRINT @name + ': ' + CAST(@salary AS VARCHAR);
    FETCH NEXT FROM emp_cursor INTO @id, @name, @salary;
END;

CLOSE emp_cursor;
DEALLOCATE emp_cursor;
\`\`\`

Cursors are kind of confusing at first because there's so much boilerplate. But basically: DECLARE sets it up, OPEN starts it, FETCH gets rows, CLOSE and DEALLOCATE clean up.

## SQLite reality

SQLite doesn't have WHILE loops or cursors in SQL. You'd handle iteration in your application code. The challenges here simulate concepts with recursive CTEs.` },

    theory: { content: `
User-defined functions let you write custom functions that work just like built-in ones (UPPER, ROUND, etc.). Write the logic once, call it anywhere in your queries.

There are two main types in T-SQL:
- **Scalar functions**: return a single value
- **Table-valued functions**: return a whole table

## scalar FUNCTION (T-SQL)

\`\`\`sql
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetSalaryTier(@salary DECIMAL)
RETURNS NVARCHAR(20)
AS BEGIN
    RETURN CASE
        WHEN @salary >= 100000 THEN 'Senior'
        WHEN @salary >= 75000 THEN 'Mid'
        ELSE 'Junior'
    END
END;

-- use it like any function
SELECT name, dbo.GetSalaryTier(salary) AS tier
FROM employees;
\`\`\`

## table-valued FUNCTION (T-SQL)

\`\`\`sql
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetDeptEmployees(@dept NVARCHAR(50))
RETURNS TABLE
AS RETURN (
    SELECT name, salary, hire_date
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = @dept
);

-- use it like a table
SELECT * FROM dbo.GetDeptEmployees('Engineering');
\`\`\`

Table-valued functions can be joined, filtered, and used anywhere a regular table can.

## SQLite reality

SQLite doesn't support CREATE FUNCTION in SQL. You'd register functions through your application code. For class purposes, we simulate the concept with CASE expressions and views.

## UDF vs stored procedure

    theory: { content: `
A trigger fires automatically when something happens to a table. You don't call it, the database runs it for you. Super useful for audit trails and enforcing rules.

Triggers are kind of confusing at first because you have to think about when things run. But once you get it, they're powerful.

## T-SQL trigger syntax

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TRIGGER trg_employee_audit
ON employees
AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
AS BEGIN
    -- inserted table: new rows (INSERT and UPDATE)
    -- deleted table: old rows (DELETE and UPDATE)

    INSERT INTO audit_log (action, emp_name, changed_at)
    SELECT 'INSERT', name, GETDATE() FROM inserted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'DELETE', name, GETDATE() FROM deleted;
END;
\`\`\`

## the inserted AND deleted tables

This is the confusing part but it's actually pretty logical:

| Operation | inserted | deleted |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| INSERT | new row | empty |
| UPDATE | new values | old values |
| DELETE | empty | deleted row |

So for UPDATE, you have both. That's how you compare old vs new values.

## SQLite syntax

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TRIGGER trg_salary_audit
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN OLD.salary != NEW.salary  -- optional condition
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO salary_log (emp_id, old_sal, new_sal, changed_at)

-- parameterized dynamic SQL (prevents SQL injection)
DECLARE @dept NVARCHAR(50) = 'Engineering';
DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX) = N'
    SELECT name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = @deptParam';

EXEC sp_executesql @sql,
    N'@deptParam NVARCHAR(50)',
    @deptParam = @dept;
\`\`\`

Why sp_executesql? Because it uses parameters instead of string concatenation. If someone passes \`'; DROP TABLE employees; --\` as the department name, it won't execute the DROP.

## when to use dynamic SQL

- Column/table names from user input (can't parameterize these)
- Building complex WHERE clauses dynamically
- Pivot queries with unknown column names
- Generic reporting tools

## when NOT to use it

- When a regular query works fine
- Without parameterization (SQL injection risk)
- For simple filters (just use WHERE)

## SQLite note

SQLite doesn't have EXEC or sp_executesql. Dynamic SQL is handled in application code. The challenges here use query construction concepts.` },

    title: "XML in SQL Server", badge: "practice", database: "company",
    theory: { content: `
SQL Server can output query results as XML and parse XML data. This was huge before JSON became popular. You'll still see it in older systems and SOAP web services.

Not gonna lie, XML syntax is kind of verbose compared to JSON, but it's still used a lot in enterprise systems.

## FOR XML PATH

The main way to generate XML from query results:

\`\`\`sql
-- basic XML output
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
FOR XML PATH('employee'), ROOT('employees');

-- produces:
-- <employees>
--   <employee><name>Sarah</name><salary>120000</salary></employee>
--   ...
-- </employees>
\`\`\`

## FOR XML PATH tricks

\`\`\`sql
-- attributes instead of elements
SELECT id AS '@id',   -- @ makes it an attribute
       name AS 'Name',
       salary AS 'Salary'
FROM employees
FOR XML PATH('emp'), ROOT('team');

-- produces:
-- <team>
--   <emp id="1"><Name>Sarah</Name><Salary>120000</Salary></emp>
-- </team>
\`\`\`

## reading XML with the .nodes() method

The modern way to shred XML into rows is the \`.nodes()\` method (which gives you
one row per matched element) paired with \`.value()\` to pull out attributes.

\`\`\`sql
DECLARE @xml XML = '<employees>
    <emp id="1" name="Test" salary="80000"/>
</employees>';

SELECT
    T.c.value('@id', 'int')             AS id,
    T.c.value('@name', 'nvarchar(100)') AS name
FROM @xml.nodes('/employees/emp') AS T(c);
\`\`\`

    title: "Indexes Deep Dive", badge: "challenge", database: "company",
    theory: { content: `
There are two main types and understanding the difference is important:

### Clustered Index

- Physically reorders the table data
- Only ONE per table (the data can only be sorted one way)
- Usually on the primary key
- The table IS the index basically

### Nonclustered Index

- Separate structure pointing to table rows
- Can have many per table
- Like the index in a book pointing to pages

\`\`\`sql
-- SQL Server syntax
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_pk ON employees(id);
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_dept ON employees(department);
\`\`\`

## covering indexes

A covering index includes all columns needed for a query. The database doesn't have to go back to the table because everything's in the index.

\`\`\`sql
-- this index "covers" queries that need dept + salary
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_salary ON employees(department, salary);

-- query is fully covered, no table lookup needed
SELECT department, salary FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Engineering';
\`\`\`

## WHEN indexes help

- WHERE clauses (equality and range)
- JOIN conditions
- ORDER BY columns
- GROUP BY columns

## WHEN indexes DON'T help

- Small tables (scan is faster than index lookup)
- Columns with few unique values
- Columns in functions: \`WHERE UPPER(name) = 'X'\`
- Columns you rarely query
- Tables with tons of INSERTs (index maintenance overhead)

## the INCLUDE keyword (SQL server)

\`\`\`sql
-- include extra columns without making them part of the key
CREATE INDEX idx_dept ON employees(department) INCLUDE (name, salary);
\`\`\`

This covers queries that filter on dept but need name/salary too.` },
    examples: [
      { title: "Check index usage with EXPLAIN", explanation: "See if your index is being used", sql: "-- create an index\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_dept ON employees(department);\n\n-- check if it's used\nEXPLAIN QUERY PLAN\nSELECT name, salary\nFROM employees\nWHERE department = 'Engineering';" },

    title: "Tracking Changes · Temporal Tables", badge: "challenge", database: "company",
    theory: { content: `
Temporal tables (system-versioned tables in SQL Server 2016+) automatically track the full history of every change. Want to know what someone's salary was 6 months ago? Temporal tables got you.

It's like having automatic version control for your data. Super useful for auditing and debugging.

## SQL server temporal TABLE

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE employees_temporal (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name NVARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    -- special temporal columns
    SysStartTime DATETIME2 GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START,
    SysEndTime DATETIME2 GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END,
    PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (SysStartTime, SysEndTime)
)
WITH (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (HISTORY_TABLE = dbo.employees_history));
\`\`\`

## querying historical data

\`\`\`sql
-- what was the data at a specific time?
SELECT * FROM employees
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2025-01-01 12:00:00';

-- all versions between two dates
SELECT * FROM employees
FOR SYSTEM_TIME BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-06-01';

-- entire history
SELECT * FROM employees
FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL;
\`\`\`

## change tracking (alternative approach)

SQL Server also has Change Tracking for lightweight change detection:

\`\`\`sql
-- enable change tracking
ALTER DATABASE MyDB SET CHANGE_TRACKING = ON;
ALTER TABLE employees ENABLE CHANGE_TRACKING;

-- get changes since a version
SELECT * FROM CHANGETABLE(CHANGES employees, @last_version) AS ct;
\`\`\`

This tells you WHAT changed but not the old values.

    theory: { content: `> 🎯 **Why This Matters:** Normalization is why you store a department once and point at it, instead of repeating its budget on every employee row. Repetition is how data goes wrong: update one copy, forget the other, now your numbers disagree.

The forms, in plain terms:

- **1NF**: one value per cell, no repeating groups. No \`phone1, phone2, phone3\` columns.
- **2NF**: 1NF, and every non-key column depends on the *whole* key, not part of it.
- **3NF**: 2NF, and no column depends on another non-key column. Department budget belongs on the department row, not duplicated onto every employee.

In this database \`employees.department\` is stored as text (a denormalized shortcut). The \`departments\` table holds the budget once. To get an employee's department budget you **join** instead of duplicating it.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT e.name, d.budget
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department = d.name;
\`\`\`

## anti-patterns that look fine until they don't

- **The comma-list column.** A \`tags\` column holding \`"sql,python,etl"\` cannot be joined, filtered, or counted without ugly string surgery. \`WHERE tags LIKE '%python%'\` also matches \`pythonic\`. The fix is a junction table with one row per tag.
- **Repeating groups.** \`phone1, phone2, phone3\` columns break the moment someone has a fourth phone, and "find everyone with a given number" means checking three columns. Move them to a related \`phones\` table.
- **Storing what you can compute.** A stored \`age\` column is wrong the day after you write it. Store \`birth_date\` and compute age when you query.

When **is** denormalization right? In a reporting or analytics layer where the data is read far more than it is written, and a join across huge tables is the bottleneck. You denormalize on purpose, document it, and accept the duplication because you control how it gets refreshed. That is a deliberate trade, not the accidental mess above.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Over-normalizing read-heavy reporting tables. Normalize the source of truth; denormalize deliberately (and knowingly) in a reporting layer if joins get expensive.` },

You met \`OVER (ORDER BY ...)\` already. What you may not have noticed is that an ordered window has a **frame**: the slice of rows the function actually sees for the current row.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT id, total,
       SUM(total) OVER (ORDER BY order_date, id) AS running_total

When you want a moving window instead (the last 3 rows, say), you spell the frame out with \`ROWS BETWEEN\`:

    theory: { content: `## the right index turns a scan into a jump

An index is a sorted lookup structure on one or more columns. With it, the database finds matching rows directly instead of reading the whole table.

\`\`\`sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status   ON orders(status);
\`\`\`

Index the columns you **filter and join on**, the ones in your \`WHERE\` and \`ON\` clauses. A query that filters orders by \`status\` and joins on \`customer_id\` benefits from indexes on exactly those columns.

A **composite** index covers more than one column and helps when you filter on its leading columns together:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_cust_status ON orders(customer_id, status);
\`\`\`

A **covering** index includes every column a query needs, so the database answers from the index alone and never touches the table.

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** indexing everything. Each index speeds reads but slows every insert and update, because the index has to be maintained too. Index for the queries you actually run, then verify with EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN.

> 💡 **Key:** an index on a column you never filter or join on is pure overhead. Match indexes to your real query patterns, not to a hunch.

Write the query below; it filters orders by status, which is exactly the kind of column worth indexing.` },

This is a synthesis lesson. No new syntax, just the pieces you already have working together on a real question: who are our best customers, and which products drive the most revenue.

Ranking customers by spend needs a join (customers to orders), an aggregate (SUM of order totals), and a window (RANK over that sum):

\`\`\`sql
SELECT c.name,
       SUM(o.total) AS total_spent,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(o.total) DESC) AS spend_rank
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
ORDER BY spend_rank;
\`\`\`

Notice the window function sits on top of the aggregate: \`RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(o.total) DESC)\` ranks the grouped totals. That layering, aggregate first, window over the result, is the move that unlocks most real reporting.

> 💡 **Key:** you can use an aggregate inside a window's ORDER BY. The database computes the GROUP BY, then ranks the grouped rows. This is how leaderboards, top-N-per-group, and share-of-total reports get written.` },

The school database has students, courses, and enrollments. The questions are different but the moves are the same: join across the relationship, aggregate, filter the groups with HAVING, and rank within a slice.

Department activity comes from joining courses to enrollments and counting:

\`\`\`sql

       COUNT(*) AS enrollments
FROM courses co
JOIN enrollments e ON e.course_id = co.id

\`COUNT(DISTINCT e.student_id)\` counts unique students, while \`COUNT(*)\` counts every enrollment row, so a department where students take multiple courses shows the gap.

    theory: { content: `## the final synthesis: hierarchy, joins, and ranking together

The company database is where everything you learned meets: a self-referencing hierarchy, a many-to-many through a junction table, and salaries to rank.

Counting direct reports is a self-join on the employees table:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT m.name AS manager, COUNT(e.id) AS reports
FROM employees m
JOIN employees e ON e.manager_id = m.id
GROUP BY m.id, m.name
ORDER BY reports DESC;
\`\`\`

The same table appears twice with two aliases: \`m\` for the manager, \`e\` for the report. Joining \`e.manager_id = m.id\` connects each employee to their boss.

Ranking salaries inside each department is a partitioned window:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT name, department, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM employees
ORDER BY department, dept_rank;
\`\`\`

> 💡 **Key:** \`PARTITION BY department\` restarts the ranking for each department, so every department gets its own number-one. This is the top-N-per-group pattern that shows up constantly in real reporting.
